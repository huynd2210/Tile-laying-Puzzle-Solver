A tilling puzzle (Polyominoes) solver. As far as I know, there currently isn't any such solver available that is easily accessible, easy to use, efficient, decent UI, and allow the addition of custom pieces. This solver solves all the mentioned problems.

It contains a Flask-web UI, easy to use and intuitive. It converts the tilling problem into a SAT problem and uses a SAT solver to solve it.
